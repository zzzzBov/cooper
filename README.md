> 🚧 Work in progress 🚧

Cooper is a JavaScript web framework designed to work with the web platform.

What sets Cooper apart from other frameworks is that it's built with a collection of [guiding principles][]:

- It uses the native web platform over client side code.

- It is accessible by default.

- Simple things are simple; complex things are possible.

- It is a progressive enhancement to the page.

- It is feature rich.

- It is opinionated.

- It is flexible.
