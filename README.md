# Cooper

> 🚧 Work in progress 🚧

Cooper is a JavaScript web framework.

What sets Cooper apart from other frameworks is that it's built with a collection of guiding principles:

- It uses the native web platform over client side code.

  - Engineers's who learn Cooper have transferrable knowledge of the web platform (HTML, CSS, JS)
  - Newer features may be used with polyfills
  - DOM access
  - Web Workers

- It is accessible by default.

  - Best practices are encouraged
  - Engineers are taught the right way to solve common problems.
  - All examples are accessible.

- The API enables engineers to fall into the pit of success.

  - APIs are streamlined toward doing things correctly.
  - All APIs enable engineers to test their code with little to no scaffolding
  - Testing mocks/fakes are provided with the framework.

- It is a progressive enhancement to the page.

  - It can be mounted in multiple places (app islands)
  - Mounting supports portals
  - Server-rendered markup can be hydrated with no special server-side setup.

- It is feature rich.

  - routing
  - data management (fetching/storing)
    - IndexedDB

- It is opinionated.

  - It uses SOLID principles.
  - It is built with TypeScript.
  - It uses objects made from classes with prototypal inheritance
  - Unintuitive behaviors are avoided/discouraged.

- It is flexible.

  - Modular dependencies can be swapped out.
  - Multiple approaches to rendering are supported.
  - Cooper can be mounted within other libraries/frameworks and versa-vice (React, Vue, Angular, etc).
  - It is tooling agnostic so that engineers can author code in whatever flavor of JavaScript they prefer.
  - It is server agnostic so that rendering markup server-side does not require any special tooling or training.

- Simple things are simple; complex things are possible.
